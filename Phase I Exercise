There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot? 

==================================================================================================================
KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? --- 1984
•	What operating system does it run? --- CP/M2.2 for KAYPRO IV (which is different from KAYPRO 4, according to the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institute)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- According to Byte Magazine Vol.09, No.01, published in 1984, KAYPRO II--from which KAYPRO 4 stemmed--is advertised as "the $1595 computer that sells for $1595." On eBay, as of October 19th, 2015, it costs $26 to $299 (with a printer). eBay guide suggests that KAYPRO 2 should be worth $25-$50, and KAYPRO 10, $50-$70. On Craigslist, KAYPRO 4 is listed for $75.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- It has a double-sided disk drive in comparison to the single-sided disk drive of KAYPRO 2.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.) --- Keypro can be turned on on the back by a switch. WardStar comes in a form of diskette. The screen prompts to place the diskette into a drive. It does not automatically run. It reads the diskette once the drive window is closes. The first line on the screen reads "A0>", inplying this is an entry for the area 0 on drive A. One can redirect the area by typing, for example, "user 7". This will display "A7>". The areas range between 0 and 15. Every time one press "RETURN", the machine responds "This?". File commands runs as a combination of "CTRL" and letters in brackets. For instance, to copy file, one presses "CTRL" and press "(K)(O)", which reads as "9^K09^L0." It is unclear how to commit command.

===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? --- 1983
•	What operating system does it run? --- DOS 3.3, ProDos
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- The original retail price for APPLE II was $1298-$2638 depending on the data storage capacity (Byte Magazine Vol. 02, No. 06, 1977). On eBay, the APPLE IIe computer itself costs $99.99 and $170.00-$299.99 including a floppy drive and a monitor. On the Craigsist, the complete set including graphics tablet and pen is listed under "best offer."
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- Apple lle is an improved version of Apple ll which was known for its memory capacity, color display, and size not larger than a typewriter case. Different product lines of Apple II (such as Apple II Plus and Apple IIe) can run the software that were originally developped for Apple II.   

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!) --- It can be turned on by a switch. It cannot be muted (to my dismay). Apple Presents Apple tutorial does not recognize "delete" and takes all type as an input. (I was soon met with a humorous description that reds: "What if you make a [gasp] mistake?"). The location of arrrows on the keyboard (left, right, down, up) takes a while to get use to. The only way to delete is to overrite by navigating with the arrows where the mistakes are.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? --- 1988
•	What operating system does it run? --- 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac? --- On Marble Springs, there is a "Margins" option that allows users to make notes on the margin of text. On this Mac, there is another document titled "We Descend" and it claims to be the archival projects of fragments of writings. On the Mac, there are programs such as Scrapbook and Quiz.

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? --- 1982
•	What operating system does it run? --- 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? ---

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics? --- Minestorm lets you play between two players by letting them take turns. There is no simltaneous interaction between two players. Given the interface is not displayed in multi color, it is difficult to tell which is your ship and among different rockets. Non-skeumorphic images of ship and rockets would not help to differenciate between the two. Options are quite simple: "escape," "thrust," and "fire," in addition to the dicrection control revolver. These methods were translated and adapted into different games such as Cosmic Chasm.

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? --- 1985
•	What operating system does it run? --- Amiga OS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). ---
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here. --- The switch of the computer is on the side and is separate from that of the monitor. Color display. The monitor prompts which floppy desk needs to be inserted (first "kickstart" and then "workbench"). Each time it reads and prepares the working condition (what's been loaded remains). Loading icon is "zz" in a bubble. Cursor is a hand with red manicured fingers.  Amiga Appetizer comes with programs such as: Write, Tile, Music, and Paint.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? --- 1991
•	What operating system does it run? --- 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? ---

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)? --- The switch is on the keyboard. WordPerfect has its navigation icons on the left side and MS Word on its top. WordPerfect's navigation is iconographic compared to that of descriptive navigation of MS Word. McPaint allows a composition of shapes and fonts with various patterns, shades, sides. There is even an option to set the color of patters (either RGB ir YCM) but that cannot be displayed given the monitor does not accomodate color display. Gird and ruler system reminds me of an elementary photoshop software.

There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot? 

==================================================================================================================
KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? --- 1984
•	What operating system does it run? --- CP/M2.2 for Kaypro IV (which is different from Kaypro 4, which was released a year after Kaypro IV.)
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- According to Byte Magazine Vol.09, No.01, published in 1984, Kaypro II--from which Kaypro 4 stemmed--is advertised as "the $1595 computer that sells for $1595." On eBay, as of October 19th, 2015, it costs $26 to $299 (with a printer). eBay guide suggests that Kaypro 2 should be worth $25-$50, and Kaypro 10, $50-$70. On Craigslist, Kaypro 4 is listed for $75.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- It has a double-sided disk drive in comparison to the single-sided disk drive of Kaypro II. Historically, Kaypro II was invented to compete with the then popular transportable microcomputer Osborne 1. As the commercial suggests, the price setting of Kaypro was more ernest than its competitors: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC-v8QGApVc>. Kaypro was success also owing to its bigger screen and its preinstalled third-party applications softwards such as WordStar. Kaypro II's memory capacity is 64KB--incredible when compared to today's standard.   

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.) --- Kaypro can be turned on by a switch on its back. WardStar comes in a form of diskette. The screen prompts to place the diskette into a drive. It reads the diskette once the drive window is closed. The first line on the screen reads "A0>", implying this is an entry for the area 0 on drive A. One can redirect the area by typing, for example, "user 7". This will display "A7>". The areas range between 0 and 15. Every time one presses "RETURN", the machine resonds with a command confirmation request, "This?". File commands run as a combination of "CTRL" and letters in brackets. For instance, to copy file, one presses "CTRL" and press "(K)(O)", which reads as "9^K09^L0". The interface is like that of Terminal on Mac that simply accomodates commands.

===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? --- 1983
•	What operating system does it run? --- DOS 3.3, ProDos
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- The original retail price for APPLE II was $1298-$2638 depending on the data storage capacity (Byte Magazine Vol. 02, No. 06, 1977). On eBay, the APPLE IIe computer itself costs $99.99 and $170.00-$299.99 including a floppy drive and a monitor. On the Craigsist, the complete set including graphics tablet and pen is listed under "best offer."
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- Apple lle is an improved version of Apple ll which was known for its memory capacity, color display, and its size (not larger than a typewriter case). Different product lines of Apple II (such as Apple II Plus and Apple IIe) can run the software that were originally developped for Apple II. Historically, Apple II's userface was groundbreaking as it carried output devices (display screen) in addition to input devices (keyboard). Apple II series were sold in a fully assembled manner--unlike Apple I--. Apple II series can display color and graphics and are able to handle audio files. Apple I and II are probably best known in association with their inventor Steve Jobs' success story.      

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!) --- It can be turned on by a switch. It cannot be muted (to my dismay). Apple Presents Apple tutorial does not recognize "delete" and takes all type as an input. (I was soon met with a humorous description that reads: "What if you make a [gasp] mistake?"). The location of arrrows on the keyboard (left, right, down, up) takes a while to get use to. The only way to delete is to overwrite by navigating with the arrows where the mistakes are. 

====================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? --- 1988
•	What operating system does it run? --- 3.3-7.5.5
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- Macintosh SE originally cost $2900 (with dual floppy) to $3900 (with 20 MB hard drive). The adjust inflation price would be around $7000. On EBay, it costs $25-$500 (with an exception of $1300, prompting a web forum "eBay is going crazay? Or Is a Mac SE collectable?"). On Craigslist, Macintosh SE usually costs around $40. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- Macintosh SE is the first compact Macintosh with an internal hard disk (either 20MB or 40MB). Interface-wise, it was the first time the combination of keyboard and mouse was introduced. Notably, this was the first model that came with an expansion slot, that allows additional boards to be connected (such as video and audio cards that come with VGA and DVI connectors, the connections we use today for projecting image/audio from our laptops, for example).

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac? --- On Marble Springs, there is a "Margins" option that allows users to make notes on the margin of text. On this Mac, there is another document titled "We Descend" and it claims to be the archival projects of fragments of writings. There are programs such as Scrapbook and Quiz.   

===================================================================================================================
VECTREX

•	What year was it made? --- 1982
•	What operating system does it run? --- it runs on CPU and a sound chip
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- Vectrex originally cost $199 ($470 adjusted for inflation). On eBay, it ranges from $100-$500. On Craigslist, there is one offer of Vectrex for $500, and six games for $275.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- It was a groundbreaking video-game console as it did not need to be connected to televisions to render graphics. The mechanism is later adapted into arcade games. The vector-based screen which displays composed lines as images (rather than pixels), and is made of plastic to avoid the flikering.    

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics? --- Minestorm lets you play between two players by letting them take turns. There is no simltaneous interaction between two players. Given the interface is not displayed in multicolors, it is difficult to tell which is your ship and among different rockets. Non-skeumorphic images of ship and rocket would not help one differenciate between the two. Options are quite simple: "escape," "thrust," and "fire," in addition to the dicrection control stick. These methods were translated and adapted into different games such as Cosmic Chasm.

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? --- 1985
•	What operating system does it run? --- Amiga OS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- Amiga 1000 cost $1295 ($2624.37 inflation adjusted) and Amiga 500--the most successful model among the Amiga series--cost $799 ($1241.82 inflation adjusted). Functioning Amiga 500 on eBay ranges from $25-$60. There are demands for Amiga series on Craigslist, but there is currently no offering.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- Amiga series came with multitasking OS called Amiga OS which introduced graphic file manager (graphic/metaphorical icons). It was the first multimedia computer that combined graphic, audio, and video functions.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here. --- The switch of the computer is on the side and is separate from that of the monitor. Color display. The monitor prompts which floppy desk needs to be inserted (first "kickstart" and then "workbench"). Each time it reads and prepares the working condition (what's been loaded remains). Loading icon is "zz" in a bubble. Cursor is a hand with red manicured fingers. Amiga Appetizer comes with programs such as: Write, Tile, Music, and Paint. According to The Future Was Here, Amiga was first recognized as game machines, but, especially video editing capacity and audio recording systems expanded the horizon of multimedia platform. 


===================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? --- 1991
•	What operating system does it run? --- System 6.0.4-7.6.1
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). --- It originally cost $5369 ($9896.39 inflation adjusted). On eBay, it costs $39.99-$549. On craigslist, there is one Macintosh IIci listed for $150. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? --- Regardless of the price, it keeps the record of robust four years before the invention of new model. It is known for exapandability, as its card slots that would be connected to ethernet, audio, video.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)? --- The switch is on the keyboard. WordPerfect has its navigation icons on the left side and MS Word on its top. WordPerfect's navigation is iconographic compared to that of descriptive navigation of MS Word. McPaint allows a composition of shapes and fonts with various patterns, shades, sides. There is even an option to set the color of patters (either RGB ir YCM) but that cannot be displayed given the monitor does not accomodate color display. Gird and ruler system reminds me of an elementary photoshop software.
